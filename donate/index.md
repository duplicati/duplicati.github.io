All people who contribute to Duplicati are volunteers. We do not get paid, but use our spare time and private resources to keep everything running. Donations help us take out larger chunks of time to work on Duplicati, pay for hosting and service fees, and generally show us your appreciation for our work on Duplicati.

We recommend that you donate through [Duplicati OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/duplicati). OpenCollective is a registered non-profit fiscal host that issues **receipts for donations**. If needed, your donation can be officially booked as an expense in your company. 

Furthermore, OpenCollective shows how the donated money is spent by the project members. Note that OpenCollective charges a percentage of the donated amount for their handling services.

If you want to back a specific feature, first make sure that it is [registered as an issue on Github](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/issues), then pledge money for the issue on [Bounty Source](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/duplicati/issues). 
The person who submits the code that closes an issue can claim the money. The person claiming the bounty does not have to be a Duplicati team member. Backing an issue directly is an incentive for people to contribute to Duplicati, for the benefit of everyone.
